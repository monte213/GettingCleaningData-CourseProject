<h2>Source Data</h2>

<p>Original source data can be found here <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip</a></p>

<p>The README contained within the data describes fully the original intent</p>

<p>From the README:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities &gt;(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its &gt;embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The &gt;experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the &gt;volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of &gt;2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated &gt;using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, &gt;therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time &gt;and frequency domain. See &#39;features_info.txt&#39; for more details. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>Only the set of variables that calculated mean and standard deviation are included in this tidy data set. More information on these variables can be found in the features_info.txt file included in the original data.</p>

<p>Variables tracked here include:</p>

<ul>
<li>tBodyAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>tGravityAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyAccJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyGyro-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyAccMag</li>
<li>tGravityAccMag</li>
<li>tBodyAccJerkMag</li>
<li>tBodyGyroMag</li>
<li>tBodyGyroJerkMag</li>
<li>fBodyAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyAccJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyGyro-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyAccMag</li>
<li>fBodyAccJerkMag</li>
<li>fBodyGyroMag</li>
<li>fBodyGyroJerkMag</li>
</ul>

<p>Subject remain unchanged from the original data</p>

<p>Activity is now descriptively labeled.</p>

<h2>Transformations</h2>

<ul>
<li>The training and test data from the original dataset was combined into one large dataset</li>
<li>Data was subset to include only columns that track mean and standard deviation</li>
<li>Activity and Subject data was added to the dataset</li>
<li>Data was transformed to calculate the average of the mean and standard deviation for each tracked variable broken out by Activity and Subject</li>
<li>A file, &#39;tidy_data.txt&#39; is generated from the resulting transformation</li>
</ul>
